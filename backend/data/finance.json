  },
  {
    "question": "How do I read my credit report?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is dollar-cost averaging?",
    "answer": "Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount regularly regardless of market conditions. This approach reduces the impact of volatility by buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high, averaging out costs over time."
  },

Unlike traditional IRAs, there's no required minimum distribution, and you can withdraw contributions (not earnings) penalty-free before retirement."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I negotiate a better salary?",
    "answer": "Research market rates for your position, prepare a list of accomplishments and value you bring, practice your pitch, choose the right timing, be professional and respectful, consider total compensation (benefits, bonuses), and be prepared to negotiate non-salary benefits if needed."
